Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christe's curse,
For of thy parsley yet fare they the worse.

That they have eaten in thy stubble goose:
For in thy shop doth many a fly go loose.

Now tell on, gentle Roger, by thy name,
But yet I pray thee be not wroth for game;
A man may say full sooth in game and play.
